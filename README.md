# TimeExplorer

This is a new method (feature extraction for time series). The method
is based on eleven characterizations of line graphs presenting time series.
These characterizations include measures, such as, means, standard
deviations, differences, and periodicities

This is the implementation of the paper:

** TimeExplorer: Similarity Search Time Series by Their Signatures **

Tuan Nhon Dang and Leland Wilkinson 

Following the notebook **examples.ipynb** to see how use the algorithm.
